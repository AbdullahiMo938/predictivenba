NBA Games Data Analysis with Python
Overview
This repository contains Python code for analyzing NBA games data. The code includes data preprocessing, feature selection, and model training using scikit-learn, with a focus on predicting outcomes of NBA games.

Features
Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and transforming the NBA games dataset for analysis.
Feature Selection: Using SequentialFeatureSelector for optimal feature selection.
Model Training: Implementing a RidgeClassifier for prediction.
Backtesting: A custom function to evaluate the model's performance.
Data Scaling: Utilizing MinMaxScaler for scaling selected features.
Installation
To run this project, you need Python 3.x and the following libraries:

pandas
scikit-learn
You can install these packages using pip:

bash
Copy code
pip install pandas scikit-learn
Usage
Data Preparation: The script begins by reading and preprocessing the NBA games dataset.
Feature Selection and Model Training: It then selects features and trains a RidgeClassifier model.
Backtesting: The model's performance is evaluated using a custom backtesting function.
Result Analysis: Finally, the accuracy and predictions of the model are displayed.
To run the script, simply execute the Python file:

bash
Copy code
python nba_games_analysis.py
Dataset
The dataset used is 'nba_games.csv', which should be placed in the same directory as the script.
